/**
 * 1. Content Analysis
 * Keyword Density: High density of known spam-related keywords or phrases.
 * Link Count: Excessive number of hyperlinks in the message.
 * HTML Content: Presence of HTML tags where plain text is expected.
 * Unusual Characters: Overuse of special characters or nonsensical strings.
 * 2. Submission Patterns
 * Submission Frequency: Rapid consecutive submissions from the same IP address.
 * Session Duration: Very short duration between form view and submission, which might indicate automated submission.
 * Form Completion Time: If the form was filled out suspiciously quickly, beyond human capability.
 * 3. Source Analysis
 * IP Reputation: Check if the IP address is known for sending spam (using services like Akismet or a custom IP blacklist).
 * Geolocation Mismatch: Inconsistency between the IP geolocation and the provided location information (if relevant).
 * 4. User Behavior
 * Interaction with CAPTCHA: Failure or unusual patterns in interacting with CAPTCHA challenges.
 * Honeypot Fields: Interaction with hidden fields that should be ignored by human users.
 * Mouse and Keyboard Dynamics: Analyzing behavior can be complex but can indicate bot-like interactions (mostly applicable in sophisticated systems).
 * 5. Email Analysis
 * Email Domain Reputation: Check if the email domain is commonly associated with spam or is from a disposable email provider.
 * Syntax Irregularities: Unusual formatting or characters in the email address.
 * 6. Historical Data Analysis
 * Repeat Offenders: Increase score for IP addresses or email domains that have previously submitted spam.
 * Feedback Loop: Incorporating feedback from users or admins who manually mark leads as spam or not spam.
